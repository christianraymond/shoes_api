# Shoes-Api Web Application
A friend of your brother is running a shoe shop and already have an online catalogue that allows people to check his stock. But he would like to make his inventory available to other systems. He heard about APIâ€™s and think that his shop will really benefit from having an API.

He wants an API that can:
- List all shoes in stock
- List all shoes for a given brand
- List all shoes for a given size
- List all shoes for a given brand and size
- Update the stock levels when a shoe is sold
- Add a new new shoe to his stock.
